        <h2>Locating the nearest garage, spare-part centers, and mechanics in case of emergencies has been one of the greatest challenges over decades in case of a mechanical breakdown.
          Most drivers always get stuck on the way to their destinations due to failure or delay to get mechanical services. 
          This leads to a number of inconveniences such as missing important appointments, increased damage in case one tries to forcefully move the vehicle to reach the nearest garage, accidents, etc
          We have come up with a mobile application called MobiGarage that will help drivers to easily locate Oriental Motors Garage, call for a mechanic, book for car services and order for spare-parts.
